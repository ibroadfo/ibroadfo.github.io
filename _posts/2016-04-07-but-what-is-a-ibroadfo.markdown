title: "but what is a 'ibroadfo'?"
---
i'm a total SJW[^1] who got infected in my early teens by iain banks' Culture stories, so now i'm pretty disappointed we're not yet living in an anarcho-techno-utopia.

i do the things with the computers. in theory i'm full stack but in practise i like focusing on one bit at a time; recently that's meant a lot of ember.js. (pretend there's a long list of acronyms here)

it's better to be kind than to be right.

i have a couple of mental health problems which disable me in frustrating ways, but i'm mostly coping most of the time.

i don't currently have any pets, which makes me sad.
